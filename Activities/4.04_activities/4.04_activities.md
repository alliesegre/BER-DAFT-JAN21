We could if we grouped the salary into smaller chunks, but it would not be the most appropriate approach as the variable salary is continuous, in this case, a t-test (or other categorical - continuous tests) would be a better option. You can also generate a new categorical variable with values ['HIGH_INCOME', 'LOW_INCOME']. Discuss the results.
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

data_crosstab = pd.crosstab(np.where(data['INCOME']>3,'HIGH_INCOME', 'LOW_INCOME'), data['GENDER'], margins = False)
chi2_contingency(data_crosstab, correction=False)

# 1
data_crosstab2 = pd.crosstab(data['STATE'], data['DOMAIN'], margins = False)
chi2_contingency(data_crosstab2, correction=False)
As you would see the p value is 0 in this case. Also, the p value is less than 0.05. This being said, we reject the null hypothesis. Now, we can say that the variables are correlated to each other and drop one of the variables.

# 2
data = data.drop(['STATE'], axis=1)

We won't use normalizer because it doesn't work as expected, so we will be using either minmax or standard scalers. They perform fairly good so you can choose the one you like the most. We could even use a robust scaler for some of the features.
