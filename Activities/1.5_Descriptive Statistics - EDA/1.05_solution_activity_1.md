```python
import numpy as np

# 1
df = pd.read_csv('merged_clean_ver1.csv')
```
```python
# 2
df.dtypes
```
```python
# 3
df.describe(include=[np.float])
```

4. For the last question, discuss the difference between population and random samples in statistics. Also mention population standard deviation and sample standard deviation. Use the math library to show the difference in results by using the methods on a list.

```python
# 4
import numpy as np

population = list(np.random.random(5000))
print(round(np.mean(population),2))

print("Population mean = ",round(np.mean(population),2))
print("Population standard deviation = ",round(np.std(population),2))

for i in range(10):
    sample = list(np.random.choice(population, 400, replace = False))
    print("Sample ",i)
    print("----------")
    print("Sample mean = ", round(np.mean(sample),2))
    print("Sample standard deviation = ", round(np.std(population, ddof=len(sample)-1),2))
    print()
```
