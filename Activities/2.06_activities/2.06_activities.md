When the text is not standardized and there may be a few different ways in which users might use certain words, for example, gray and grey b. To extract the results when you might know that there might be spelling errors in the input text.

Some other problems that can arise due to non-normalization of the database are:

Slower query processing (which would be due to inefficient storage of data) Data anomalies (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). We will talk about the anomalies in detail in the later lessons Database maintenance becomes tedious

No separate gist added here. The question is to identify the primary and foreign keys in the tables from the database entity relationship diagram


Lesson_2.06_solution_activity_4.md
The given example does not follow referential integrity constraint. The company_id is present as a primary key in the table InsuranceCompany and it is present as a foreign key in the table InsurancePlan. Hence, the table InsurancePlan can not take any value of the company_id that is not present in the table InsuranceCompany.

-- 2a:
insert into bank.loan values(8000,8000000,930705,96396,12,8033.0,'C')
Note, there is the second value which is 8000000, corresponds to the account_id. We can check that no such account_id exists in the account table. Hence, this is a referential integrity constraint. If the tables are designed well, Inserting a record in a table referring a non-existing value in the table with the primary key should raise an error.

-- 2b: delete from bank.account where account_id=11382
The account_id is the primary key in the account table. If there are related records in any other table that are using this particular account_id (foreign key), then this would result in an error.

create table card (
  card_id int(11) default null,
  disp_id int(11) default null,

insert into card values (1005,9285,'classic','931107 00:00:00\r'),

Some valid ideas for better database structure would be

Add FK Account -> Client
alter table bank.account
add column client_id int null;

alter table bank.account
add constraint fk_account_1
  foreign key (client_id)
  references bank.client (client_id)
  on delete no action
  on update no action;
Add FK Card -> Account
alter table bank.card
add column client_id int null;

alter table bank.card
add constraint fk_card_1
  foreign key (client_id)
  references bank.client (client_id)
  on delete no action
  on update no action;
Rename district columns
alter table district change A1 to district_id;
alter table district change A2 to district_name;
alter table district change A3 to region;
alter table district change A3 to population;
alter table district change A5 to num_muni_very_small;
alter table district change A6 to num_muni_small;
alter table district change A7 to num_muni_medium;
alter table district change A8 to num_muni_large;
alter table district change A9 to num_cities;
alter table district change A10 to urban_ratio;
alter table district change A11 to avg_salary;
alter table district change A12 to unmployment_rate_95;
alter table district change A13 to unmployment_rate_96;
alter table district change A14 to entrepreneurs;
alter table district change A15 to crimes_95;
alter table district change A16 to crimes_96;
