The standard normal distribution (z distribution) is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Any point (x) from a normal distribution can be converted to the standard normal distribution (z) with the formula z = (x-mean) / standard deviation. z for any particular x value shows how many standard deviations x is away from the mean for all x values.
