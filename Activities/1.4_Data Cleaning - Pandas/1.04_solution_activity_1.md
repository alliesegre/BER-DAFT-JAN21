### Code

```python
data = data[data['ic4'].isna()==False]
data = data[data['ic5'].isna()==False]
```

### Class debate

1. As a general rule, one can say that if the data in the column has a lot of outliers, then it is preferable to choose median over mean, otherwise you can choose the mean. One advantage when you use these imputation techniques is that you do not change the mean or median of the column. It is important to note that these are not the only means of doing that. There are a lot of other methods that can be employed, which we will take a look at, in later sessions. Sometimes the missing values in the numerical column are simply replaced by a constant, usually 0. It is very case dependent. There are no hard/fixed rules.

2. Generally speaking, it would not be a good idea as you lose all the information from other columns where you do have information available. So you have to be careful when you filter out the rows with null values. You can check the percentage of data that you might lose in doing so and if it makes sense to lose that or not.
