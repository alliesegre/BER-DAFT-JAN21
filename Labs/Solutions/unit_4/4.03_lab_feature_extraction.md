# Education, employment status, policy, and vehicle class are somewhat unbalanced.
# For education we could turn it into a binary variable (college +-), but I wouldn't touch it.
# Policy is redundant, maybe we can classify it in L1, L2 and L3 groups
# Id concatenate luxury SUV, sports car and luxury car into luxury or among the other classes
# For employment we could divide them among employed, unemployed and inactive
# We can see that having open complaints isn't that common
# so we can turn it into a binary variable, open not open
# For the number of policies we could join use 1, 2, 3, 4+

# Check policy
